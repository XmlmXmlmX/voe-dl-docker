## 🐳 Docker Deployment

### Quick Start

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Downloads are saved to `./downloads` on the host by default.  
Access the web UI at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Custom Output Path

Set the `DOWNLOAD_PATH` environment variable to save downloads to any host directory:

```bash
DOWNLOAD_PATH=/mnt/media/movies docker compose up -d
```

Or create a `.env` file next to `docker-compose.yml`:

```env
DOWNLOAD_PATH=/mnt/media/movies
```

Then run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### TrueNAS Scale

In TrueNAS Scale's Docker (or Apps) configuration, map your dataset as the host path and `/downloads` as the container path.

Alternatively, add a `.env` file with `DOWNLOAD_PATH` pointing to your TrueNAS dataset mount:

```env
DOWNLOAD_PATH=/mnt/pool/dataset/movies
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DOWNLOAD_PATH` | `./downloads` | **Host** path where downloaded videos are stored |
| `DOWNLOAD_DIR` | `/downloads` | **Container** path for downloads (must match the volume's container path) |
| `DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT` | `3600` | Max download time in seconds before a job is cancelled |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Flask server listen address |
| `PORT` | `5000` | Flask server listen port |
| `FLASK_DEBUG` | `0` | Set to `1` to enable Flask debug mode |

Make sure the URL is valid and doesn't contain brackets or formatting issues.
